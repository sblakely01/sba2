## Overview

### The challenge

For this assignment, we were asked to:

- Create a web page for a fictional company
- Utilize accessibility features like Semantic HTML, Responsive Design, Aria Roles, and Color Contrast

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Most accessibility features are not difficult to implement into web design, but they can make a huge difference for people who rely on assistive technologies.

### Reflection Questions

1. What accessibility challenges did you face, and how did you address them?

Some accessibility challenges that I faced in this project was trying to ensure that there as enough contrast between the background and text colors and ensuring that the form was legible and easy to navigate for users. I addressed these challenges by utilizing tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and by using flexbox, margins, larger fields, labels, and identifiers like aira-labelledby on the form fields.

2. How did you ensure that your design was responsive and accessible to all users?

I used a combination of contrasting colors, responsive design, semantic HTML, and aria labels and features to try and create a design that was accessible to all users. I also utilized the developer tools in Google Chrome to look at accessibility tree view, view my design on other device screen sizes, and to check and resolve all accessibility issues that were mentioned in the issues section. This included at one point that my labels were pointing to a name on some fields and not an id, which the issues section informed me would cause errors and confusion with some screen readers.

3. What tools or resources did you find most helpful during this project?

The developer tools section on Google Chrome was immensely helpful to me on this project as it helped me to catch issues that I had missed, The [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) was also very helpful.
